### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!
---

I am **Ben Onwurah**, an **Applied AI Engineer** specializing in production-ready AI systems that transform data, documents, and conversations into actionable intelligence.  

I design and deploy **end-to-end AI pipelines** — from RAG systems and content automation to multimodal voice assistants and speech intelligence tools. My work combines **LLM orchestration, vector search, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and human-in-the-loop workflows** to build real-world AI products, not just demos.  

> If you want AI systems that **work, scale, and generate value**, that’s exactly what I build.
